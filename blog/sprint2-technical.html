                If you’re thinking of building a website its likely you’ve heard the terms “HTML” and “CSS,” but may be wondering how
                they’re different. They go hand-in-hand in building a webpage, but each serve a very unique purpose. Quite simply, HTML
                (Hypertext Mark up Language) is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, and CSS (Cascade
                Styling Sheets) is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and
                background colour.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an selector is a name preceded by a hash
                character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a
                class can be used to identify more than one.
            </p>

              <p>
                
                This allows you to set a particular style for many HTML elements with the same class. The class selector uses the HTML
                class attribute, and is defined with a “.” Id is used when we have to apply CSS property to one attribute only.
              </p>
              <p>
                A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block contains one or more declaration separated by semicolons.
                Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value, separated by a colon.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ID selector uses the id attribute of the HTML element, and is defined with a ‘#’. Class: The class selector is used
                to specify a style for a group of elements. Unlike the ID selector, the class selector is most often used on several
                elements.</p>

                The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used
                to identify more than one. You can also apply a selector to a specific HTML element by simply stating the HTML selector
                first, so p.jam { /* whatever */ } will only be applied to paragraph elements that have the class “jam”. The benefit of
                this is that you can have the same HTML element, but present it differently depending on its class or ID. In the CSS, a
                class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”).
