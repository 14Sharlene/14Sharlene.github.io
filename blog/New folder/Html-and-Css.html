  HTML is a element document the brings structure to the page a screen display, paper or in other media. (the Hypertext Markup Language) and the CSS (Cascading Style sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. Css the visual and aural layout, for a variety of devices. Css saves a lot of work, it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. The difference between the html and css is simply is html is used to create the actual content of a page, such as written text, and css is responsive for the design or style of the website, including the layout special effects and background colour.
</p>
<p>
  There are three types of CSS which are given below:
  •	Inline CSS
  •	Internal or embedded CSS
  •	External CSS
  Inline Css contains the css property in the body section attached with elements is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using style attributes.
</p>
<p>
  Internal or Embedded Css: this can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The Css rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section ie. The CSS is embedded within the HTML file.
</p>
<p>
  External CSS external css contains separate css files which contains only style property with the help of a tag attributes. Property written in a separate file with. Css extension and should be linked to the html document using link tag. This means the for each element,style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.
</p>
<p>
  Properties of CSS: inline css has the highest priority, then comes internal/embedded followed by external CSS which has the least priority. Multiple style sheets can be defined on one page. If for an HTML tag, style are defined in multiple style sheets then the below order will be followed.
</p>
<p>
   As inline has the highest priority, any styles that are defined in the internal and external style sheets are overridden by inline styles. Internal or Embedded stands second in the priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet. External style sheets have the least priority. If there are no styles defined either in inline or internal style sheet then external style sheet reles are applied for the HTML tag
