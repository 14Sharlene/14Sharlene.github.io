                     <h2 class="subtitle is-3">A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</h2>
                      <p>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies.<em>
                      One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go<em>
                      to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his <em>
                      mother to prepare the hangi.</p>

                    <p>
                        Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to<em>
                      annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, <em>
                      The ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe <em>
                      (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching<em>
                      Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes)<em>
                      situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.</p>

                    <p>While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai<em>
                      (food). He was immediately recognised.</p>
