          <h3><strong>What Surprised me the most about learning core is:</strong></h3>
          <p>

              Learning Core is a nice way to look back on all the activities you went threw and what you felt like in the misted of it all.

          </p>

          
         <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4> 
         <p>


         </p>

         <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4> 
         <p>

         </p>

          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

          <h4> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h4>

          <h4>Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h4>
           Justify your answer.
