  <p><strong>What Surprised me the most about learning core is</strong></p>

  <p>
         What parts of your strategy worked? 

          What problems did you face?

          What questions did you have while coding?

          What resources did you find to help you answer them?

          What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out?

          If so, what?

          Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

          How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

          Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

          Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?



      What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
      I learnt 


      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?


      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?


      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?



      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
      No! i dont feel that it is a waste of time due to the fact that programming can invole or turn into a very stress full excerise, the stress relife is wellcome and valueable to the course as part of learning, Self care and maintainance.
