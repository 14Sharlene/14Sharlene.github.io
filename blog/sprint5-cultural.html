          <h3><strong>What Surprised me the most about learning core is:</strong></h3>
          <h4>What parts of your strategy worked? </h4> 
          <p> 
              

          </p>
          <h4>What problems did you face?</h4>
          <p>

          </p>

            <h4>What questions did you have while coding?</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <h4>What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <h4>What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out?</h4>

            <h4>If so, what?</h4>
            
          
            <h4>Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h4>
          
            <h4>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h4>
            
            <h4>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</h4> 
          
            <h4>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h4>

                

              <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>

              I learnt 
            

              <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

          
              <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            
              <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

            

              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
              Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?
                                
                                Justify your answer.
                              
              No! i dont feel that it is a waste of time due to the fact that programming can invole or turn into a very stress full excerise, the stress relife is wellcome and valueable to the course as part of learning, Self care and maintainance.
