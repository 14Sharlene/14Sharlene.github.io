          <h3><strong>What Surprised me the most about learning core is:</strong></h3>
          <p>
              Learning Core is a nice way to look back on all the activities you went threw and what you felt like in the misted of it all.  
              I was sure with practice it would get better at this emotional openess.  I have enjoyed learning at a hightened spead that the 
              information is comeing in from all sides at once. all welcome all positive and helping me grow as a person and loving every minute.
              I found that youtube was a great teacher when i could not understand why and how things were done.  With this in mind i wanted to 
              share this in my pages to help others.This type of learning can be uncomfortable at first, especially if you are use to step by
              step instructions. But this way, you will learn quicker than you ever thought possible. Welcome to the World of Web Development!

         <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4> 
         <p>
            As a person i am learning the love and freedom of learning what i need to know when i need to know it faster than ever before.
            As it was pointed on everything has been done before and in so many different ways that the internet has everything we need to learn
            to the point that all things are possible at a moments recall. Neuroplasticity was the most interesting thing i have read and enjoyed 
            it as a subject and have taken on alot of its teaching when i comes to drinking and eating right and feeding the brain more than the body.
            The listening loop was interesting as well feeling listened to as well as feeling that you have heared everything that 
            someone else had to say.  The exchange of information was with clare understanding and an enjoyable transferance.  learning the differenance
            between eq and iq, controling your emotions and identifing them so they can becontroled.

         <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4> 
         <p> As social animals, humans' emotions significantly impact our relationships, the very substance of our society. On an individual level,
            the ability to recognize our own emotions, to distinguish and control them, and to recognize and empathize with the emotions of others
            are the cornerstones of emotional intelligence. Individuals vary considerably in their abilities on these rather distinct measures,
            typically being stronger in one or two than in the others.
         </p>

          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

          <P>
              because you are always thinking about where and how we can fit in or what the best and strongest skills we bring to the table it makes it 
              viable for core to be a major componant of our learning . Some of the contracts you deal with are overseas and need to have people who can
              work well with others and manage themselves well. People
          </P>

          <h4> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h4>

          <h4>Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h4>
           Justify your answer.
