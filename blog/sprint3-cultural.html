                <h2><strong>The difference between EQ and IQ?</strong> </h2>

          <h2><strong>Why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</strong> </h2>

                
                  IQ hasn't been found to be a good predictor of success in life or in business. In fact higher IQ tends to be counter-intuitive to achieving such success. A better predictor of success is Emotional Intelligence or EQ (one's emotional quotient). Although under-recognized, it plays a pervasive role in our everyday interactive life.
                

                
                  As social animals, humans' emotions significantly impact our relationships, the very substance of our society. On an individual level, the ability to recognize our own emotions, to distinguish and control them, and to recognize and empathize with the emotions of others are the cornerstones of emotional intelligence. Individuals vary considerably in their abilities on these rather distinct measures, typically being stronger in one or two than in the others.
