    Honesty which means to be free of deceit and truthful even sincere. Define the quality of being fair and truthful. The quality of being honest uprightness and fairness. This is important to me as I am not the kind of person that can put up with dishonesty. I value honest and as it can be very frustrating dealing with lies. People that are dishonest can be very damaging to others and this is not something I have tolerance to deal with. How I demonstrate this is by being true to others, in turn you are being true to yourself. This gives a sense of satisfaction that things will move forward a lot faster for honesty is attained.

  Empathy this is the ability to understand to share the feelings of others. Definition the psychological identification with or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another. This is the experience of understanding another person’s condition form their perspective. You place yourself in their shoes meet an understanding but don’t take the emotions upon yourself. I love talking to people and if I am able to help them I will, but I feel that it is important to not take their problem on emotionally at it would be counterproductive. How I demonstrate this is being a good listener and trying my best to get the full picture, I had close friends which we would share our feeling and help each other to getting threw things by being sound boards for each other.

  Awhina which means to be of help to someone, to be of support to someone in time of need and to ‘lift up’ or give strength too. This is important to me as it is sharing of mana that takes place and the gratification that is gained by being of help to someone is like no other feeling. It’s what I demonstrate this is to try and help everyone I meet if I have the ability to and to find out information that could help them or another. If I have not already attained it.

<p>
  Respect is to have regard for a person’s feelings and wishes, to help fight for one’s rights. A feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements. This is important to me because I am a firm believer that you treat others as you would like to be treated and I like to be respected. So I tend to treat everyone as a friend till they do wrong and depending on how much of a wrong depends on if I will give them a wide birth.

  I have a situation where you have had a ethical decision to make?
  I could say that i took the chance, we were not sure if i would get on to the next cohot. This new meant i would be in Wellington and taking a chance, But i remember something Jack said a month before and that is being responable for our own education. There for this is what we want and i am getting it.  the ethical decision was great and had alot of delemas with it.  Such as My family there feeling and how it would effect them with me not being around for this short period of time.  The thourghts of each child were taken into consideration and there enchargement was great.  Alass there is still a government view which is very different.
  I am a Ngai Tahu ,Kai tahu, Ngai te mamoi, Waitaha maori. What are my cultural influences in my values and identity: i could say and a Bluff person we come for hunters and gathers of the seasons, with a strong work ethic, peronally if you are not working then you should be doing something else with your time ,like studies.
  Our teach that we received when younger gave us a love of culture and a inate interest in the different cultures there are.
